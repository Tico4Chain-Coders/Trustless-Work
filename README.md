# Trustless Work | [API Documentation](https://docs.trustlesswork.com/trustless-work)
It enables trustless payments via smart contracts, securing funds in escrow until milestones are approved by clients. Stablecoins like USDC are used to ensure stability and ease of use.

## Installing Rust

### Linux, macOS, or Unix-like Systems

If you're using macOS, Linux, or any other Unix-like system, the simplest method to install Rust is by using `rustup`. Install it with the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Windows

On Windows, download and run `rustup-init.exe`. You can proceed with the default setup by pressing `Enter`.

You can also follow the official Rust guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Install the wasm32 target.

After installing Rust, add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```



## Install Stellar CLI

There are a few ways to install the [latest released version](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/releases) of Stellar CLI.

The toolset installed with Rust allows you to use the `cargo` command in the terminal to install the Stellar CLI.

### Install with cargo from source:

```sh
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt
```

### Install with cargo-binstall:

```sh
cargo install --locked cargo-binstall
cargo binstall -y stellar-cli
```

### Install with Homebrew (macOS, Linux):

```sh
brew install stellar-cli
```



## Configuring the CLI for Testnet

Stellar has a test network called Testnet that you can use to deploy  and test your smart contracts. It's a live network, but it's not the  same as the Stellar public network. It's a separate network that is used for development and testing, so you can't use it for production apps.  But it's a great place to test your contracts before you deploy them to  the public network.

To configure your CLI to interact with Testnet, run the following command:

### macOS/Linux

```sh
stellar network add \
  --global testnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```sh
stellar network add `
  --global testnet `
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 `
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
```

Note the `--global` flag. This creates a file in your home folder's `~/.config/soroban/network/testnet.toml` with the settings you specified. This means that you can use the `--network testnet` flag in any Stellar CLI command to use this network from any directory or filepath on your system.

If you want project-specific network configurations, you can omit the `--global` flag, and the networks will be added to your working directory's `.soroban/network` folder instead.

###  Configure an Identity

When you deploy a smart contract to a network, you need to specify an identity that will be used to sign the transactions.

Let's configure an identity called `alice`. You can use any name you want, but it might be nice to have some named identities that you can use for testing, such as [`alice`, `bob`, and `carol`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob). 

```sh
stellar keys generate --global alice --network testnet
```

You can see the public key of `alice` with:

```sh
stellar keys address alice
```

You can use this [link](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet) to verify the identity you create for the testnet.



## Deploy Project on Testnet



### Build contract

Once you have fully set up the contract in your local environment, installed all the necessary tools, and properly configured your user for the testnet, you will be ready to perform the initial deployment to the Testnet and run tests directly on the contract.

The first step is to compile the contract and generate the `.wasm` file, which can be done using the following command:

```bash
stellar contract build
```

### Install contract

Before deploying the contract, you must first install it. This means uploading a version of your code to the Stellar network, which you can later use for deployment.

When you execute the following command with the parameters specific to your local environment, it will return a hash. You will need to save this hash, as it will be required in the next step.

### macOS/Linux

```bash
stellar contract install \
   --network <network> \
   --source <source_account> \
   --wasm <path_to_wasm_file>
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```bash
stellar contract install `
   --network <network> `
   --source <source_account> `
   --wasm <path_to_wasm_file>
```

Where:

- `<network>` is the name of the network you are working on (e.g., testnet).
- `<source_account>` is the account from which the installation will be made (you need to provide your own account).
- `<path_to_wasm_file>` is the path to the `.wasm` file generated when compiling the contract."

Response:

```
d36cd70c3b9c999e172ecc4648e616d9a49fd5dbbae8c28bef0b90bbb32fc762
```



### Deploy contract

Finally, to deploy the contract, you will need to use the output from the previous command as the input parameter for this command.

Once you execute this command, you will receive another hash, which will be the contract ID. With this ID, you can query platforms such as https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet and continuously monitor the interactions made with the deployed contract.

### macOS/Linux

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
   --wasm-hash <wasm_hash> \
   --source <source_account> \
   --network <network>
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```bash
stellar contract deploy `
   --wasm-hash <wasm_hash> `
   --source <source_account> `
   --network <network>
```

Where:

- `<wasm_hash>` is the hash of the `.wasm` file generated during the contract installation.
- `<source_account>` is the account from which the deployment will be made.
- `<network>` is the network you are working on (e.g., testnet).
